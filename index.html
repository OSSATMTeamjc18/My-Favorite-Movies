    <h2><i><u>The Star Wars Franchise</u></i></h2>

    <p>The Star Wars Franchise would have to be my all time favorite franchise to watch. The movies are great but there is even more to the franchise. If you really like the movies then the TV shows that have come out will make them even better.</p>
